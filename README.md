# Star Citizen Auto Ping
An Autohotkey script that automatically pings so your finger doesn't fall off. Autohotkey is a macro program for making life easier. Automation of key presses is generally not considered cheating unless it gives an unfair or advantage. According to developers from Epic Games, EAC does not care about AHK, and isn't any different than using a fancy keyboard. Still, use at your own risk.

Requires AutoHotKey V2. Download from here: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/

For use with Star Citizen to rectify the issue of having to spam press-hold tab for scanning, which is quite cumbersome, for the purposes of night vision. Can also be used for mining too.
Intended use: 
1. For people who have disabilities where they can't spam ping, or who can't really bind ping to whatever input device they're using.
2. For testing purposes, to see what an auto ping feature in the game would be like. 
Please don't use it with the intention of scanning out players for pvp purposes, as it would be an unfair advantage.

Default use:
Control + Tab to start pinging every 4 seconds.
Press Control + Tab again to reduce ping time to 2 seconds.
Press Control + Tab again to stop pinging.
Press Y (seat leave button) at any time to stop pinging.
Press F12 at any time to terminate the script. Alternatively, close it in the system tray.

Feel free to edit the timing variables in the script, they're in milliseconds.
